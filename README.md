# MultiframeDenseposeNotebook
A Google Colab-compatible notebook for multiframe masking with Densepose. Primarily [based on the work of tugstugi](https://github.com/tugstugi/dl-colab-notebooks) just add some code for working with several images. I used this to create masks grayscale from the UV's so this is specifically geared toward that.
